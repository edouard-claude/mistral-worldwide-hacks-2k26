## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`swarm/`](./swarm/) | Darwinian multi-agent debate arena powered by Mistral |
| [`backend-relay/`](./backend-relay/) | HTTP/WS relay between Game Master and Swarm arena |
| [`mistralski/`](./mistralski/) | **Game Master "Mistralski"** — autonomous adversarial AI that crafts news, manipulates the player, and strategizes against arena agents |
| [`frontend/`](./frontend/) | **Gorafi USSR Front** — Cold War retro-Soviet dashboard (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui) |
| [`monitoring-sessions/`](./monitoring-sessions/) | **Debate Autopsy Dashboard** — Visualize agent genealogies, political evolution, and debate transcripts from arena sessions |

### Mistralski — Game Master Agent

The GM is an **autonomous Mistral-powered agent** with its own memory, per-agent vision files, and multi-turn strategy. It plays the role of Eric Cartman running a satirical disinformation dashboard.

**Key features:**
- Mistral Large function calling with 5 tools (read/write memory, agent vision files)
- Generates 3 news per turn (real/fake/satirical) with full Gorafi-style articles
- **Propaganda poster generation** via Mistral Agent API (Flux) — 3 images per turn
- **Multilingual** — `?lang=fr` or `?lang=en` on all endpoints
- Secretly manipulates the player into choosing the strategically optimal news
- **3-level SSE visibility**: core gameplay / GM journal (inner monologue) / end-game manipulation reveal
- Maintains persistent dossiers on each arena agent (threat level, vulnerabilities, targeted strategy)
- SSE streaming endpoints for real-time frontend integration
- Connects to the Swarm arena via the backend-relay (HTTP + WebSocket)

### Frontend — Gorafi USSR Front

CRT-styled propaganda dashboard built with React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

**Key features:**
- Real-time SSE streaming of GM reasoning (tool calls, vision updates, inner monologue)
- 3-column layout: propaganda news cards / center stage / agent panel + GM terminal
- Soviet-style propaganda posters generated by Mistral (Flux) displayed per news
- Full i18n (French / English) with language switcher
- Live agent debate feed from the Swarm arena via WebSocket relay
- End-game reveal: GM's secret manipulation history and success rate
